<p>There are currently two primary panels accessible for accessing the
rf locking and timing controls for the laser.</p>
<p>The user panel will load a panel that provides inputs in degrees to
the laser timing control. This is designed to match what operations in
ACR is familiar with on the NC systems. The configuration file for the
laser provides the frequency used to convert. The controls on this panel
talk to the phase offset controls in the Script I/O panel accessible in
the expert controls.</p>

<p>The expert controls should be familiar to those used to LCLS-I. The
panel presents the same information, and can be used in much the same
way, though the route the data gets to the panel, from ATCA firmware
registers and such, is different.</p>
